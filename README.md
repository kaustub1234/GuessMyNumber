# GuessMyNumber

GuessMyNumber is simple and fun game to play in free time ⏳⏳, where the user has to enter
numbers randomly from 1 to 20 and check, if the number entered by the user 
is same as the number generated by the system then the user wins, but with 
every incorrect guess the user will lose one score, and if the score becomes 
zero the user losses the game and he has to try again. Hope you like this game 😃😃😃...

The game is built using html, css and javascript.
